# Applying the lab-frame acceptance to the conditional NF

**Result (clean no-eta event sample):**

\[
\boxed{\sigma_{\rm lab}^{\rm NF}
=9{,}155.14 \pm 8.92\ \text{pb}}
\]

for \(p_T>20\) GeV, \(|\eta_{\rm lab}|<2.5\), \(114\)–\(2000\) GeV plus the
exact \(113.3555\)–\(114\) GeV threshold. The error is
\(\sqrt{0.77_{\rm stat}^2+6.67_{\rm tail/sample}^2+5.9_{\rm NF\,accept}^2}\).

Comparisons:

| quantity | value (pb) | difference from NF |
|---|---:|---:|
| NF lab total | **9,155.14 ± 8.92** | — |
| exact partonic lab, per-channel + threshold | 9,142.25 | +12.89 (+0.141%) |
| exact partonic lab, single acceptance + threshold | 9,137.90 | +17.24 (+0.189%) |
| native both-cuts | 9,142.3 ± 6.8 | +12.84 (+0.140%, 1.14σ) |

The NF is 0.14% above native; the exact per-channel result is 0.0005% above
native. The full bug/fix narrative is in

## 1. Why this is not just multiplying by 0.767

The current NF is trained in the **partonic CM frame** with the CM cut
\(|\eta_{\rm CM}|<2.5\). It cannot sample the no-eta distribution directly.
The lab frame requires the boost \(Y\) from the PDF luminosity:

\[
y_{\rm lab}=y_{\rm CM}+Y.
\]

The calculation therefore works event by event:

1. sample phase-space points from the NF at fixed \(\sqrt{\hat s}\);
2. map each point to the jet four-momentum in the partonic CM;
3. compute \(y_{\rm CM}\);
4. draw the boost \(Y\) from the LHAPDF luminosity for the channel;
5. apply \(|y_{\rm CM}+Y|<2.5\);
6. include both beam orderings (the NF sample is one ordering; the mirror
   ordering is \(y_{\rm CM}\to-y_{\rm CM}\) with the PDF weights swapped).

This gives the lab acceptance of the **CM-cut** NF sample,
\(f_{\rm lab|CM}(\sqrt{\hat s})\).

The CM-cut NF misses events with \(|y_{\rm CM}|>2.5\) that still pass the lab
cut. That tail is measured from the native no-eta event sample as

\[
r(\sqrt{\hat s})=\frac{P(\text{CM fail and lab pass})}{P(\text{CM pass})},
\]

and added as a small correction.

## 2. Step-by-step checks

### 2.1 NF CM total

| quantity | value |
|---|---:|
| NF CM total, 114–2000 | **11,752.44 ± 0.82 pb** |
| exact partonic CM with-cut | **11,753.90 pb** |
| ratio | **0.99988** (−0.012%) |

### 2.2 NF lab acceptance vs native CM-cut events

The NF acceptance is compared with the clean no-eta event sample restricted
to \(|y_{\rm CM}|<2.5\):

| channel | \(\sqrt{\hat s}\) | native \(f_{\rm lab|CM}\) | NF \(f_{\rm lab|CM}\) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| \(gu\to Zu\) | 150 | 0.7270 | 0.7204 |
| \(gu\to Zu\) | 200 | 0.7755 | 0.7944 |
| \(gu\to Zu\) | 300 | 0.8620 | 0.8611 |
| \(gu\to Zu\) | 500 | 0.9152 | 0.9076 |
| \(u\bar u\to Zg\) | 150 | 0.6645 | 0.6753 |
| \(u\bar u\to Zg\) | 200 | 0.6857 | 0.6812 |
| \(u\bar u\to Zg\) | 300 | 0.7006 | 0.6830 |
| \(u\bar u\to Zg\) | 500 | 0.7611 | 0.7269 |

The agreement is 1–2.5% at most points; the 500 GeV \(u\bar u\) point has only
66 events and differs by 4.5%. The integrated effect is covered by the 5.9 pb
NF-acceptance model error.

### 2.3 The two pieces

| component | value (pb) |
|---|---:|
| NF lab, CM-cut sample | **9,041.84 ± 0.77** |
| CM-fail but lab-pass tail | **+88.71** |
| NF lab full, 114–2000 | **9,130.55** |
| threshold 113.3555–114 | **+24.59** |
| **NF lab total** | **9,155.14 ± 8.92** |

Per channel:

| channel | NF CM | NF lab (CM-cut) | tail | full lab |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| \(gu\to Zu\) | 3,196.92 | 2,383.18 | 39.95 | 2,423.13 |
| \(gd\to Zd\) | 2,762.43 | 2,200.09 | 24.01 | 2,224.10 |
| \(g\bar u\to Z\bar u\) | 999.06 | 853.59 | 1.65 | 855.25 |
| \(g\bar d\to Z\bar d\) | 1,476.79 | 1,262.55 | 8.29 | 1,270.84 |
| \(u\bar u\to Zg\) | 1,683.12 | 1,124.84 | 8.21 | 1,133.04 |
| \(d\bar d\to Zg\) | 1,634.12 | 1,217.59 | 6.60 | 1,224.19 |

### 2.4 Independent consistency check

Applying the **NF acceptance to the exact CM integrand** (instead of the NF
CM integrand) gives **9,043.92 pb**, within 2.1 pb of the NF CM-cut result
9,041.84. The acceptance extraction is therefore internally consistent; the
NF CM shape contributes only ~0.02%.

### 2.5 Event-sample dependence of the tail

Two clean no-eta samples give different tails:

| sample | events | weight sum (pb) | CM fraction | tail (pb) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| earlier `native_zj_nocuts` subset | 99,611 | 11,891.7 | 0.9899 | 82.53 |
| clean LHAPDF sample | 134,848 | 11,913.95 | 0.9897 | 88.71 |

The clean sample has the correct weight sum (native no-eta 11,913 ± 10.9 pb)
and the correct CM fraction (direct CM scan 0.9896). We adopt 88.71 pb and
quote the 6.18 pb spread as an event-sample systematic. The earlier
9,148.96 pb result used the 82.53 pb tail; it is superseded by 9,155.14 pb,
with the difference inside the quoted uncertainty.

---

## 3. Caveats

1. **Hybrid tail.** The current NF is CM-cut, so the 88.71 pb tail is measured
   from native events, not sampled by the NF. A pure lab-frame NF requires
   retraining without the CM eta cut, or a flow that includes the boost \(Y\).
2. **NF acceptance accuracy.** The per-channel NF acceptance differs from the
   native CM-cut acceptance by 1–2.5% at individual energies; the weighted
   total is consistent to 0.14%. The quoted 5.9 pb NF-acceptance model error
   covers this.
3. **Threshold.** The 24.59 pb threshold piece is the exact partonic threshold
   scan, not an NF extrapolation below 114 GeV. The flat-acceptance
   interpolation gives 24.32 pb; the 0.3 pb difference is the method spread.
4. **Native comparison.** The NF 9,155.14 ± 8.92 pb and native
   9,142.3 ± 6.8 pb agree within 1.14σ. The exact per-channel 9,142.25 pb
   agrees with native to 0.0005%.
