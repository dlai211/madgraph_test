# Verification of the lab-frame row

**Row audited:** `partonic convolution × native lab acceptance | lab | pT>20, |eta|<2.5 | fine`

**Old result (superseded):** 10,599.26 pb, computed with
`pdf.xfxQ(..., 91.188**2)`.  `xfxQ` takes \(Q\) in GeV, so this evaluated the
PDFs at \(Q=8315.25\) GeV instead of \(Q=M_Z=91.188\) GeV.

**Corrected result (2026-11-10, clean event sample):** after switching to
`pdf.xfxQ2`: no-eta **11,876.96 ± 0.61 pb**; lab single acceptance
**9,113.31 pb**, per-channel + threshold **9,142.25 pb** vs native
**9,142.3 ± 6.8 pb**; CM **11,753.55 pb**; exact with-cut **11,753.90 pb**;
NF + LHAPDF CM **11,752.44 ± 0.82 pb**; NF lab **9,155.14 ± 8.92 pb**.
The old apparent 14% native deficit was the PDF-scale bug, not a native
integration error. See [`../FINDINGS.md`](../FINDINGS.md) for the full
bug/fix record and [`NORMALIZATION_GAP.md`](NORMALIZATION_GAP.md) for the
scale-bug report.

The detailed methodology below remains valid (luminosity Jacobian, event
kinematics, acceptance extraction, channel checks). Where it quotes
10,599.26 / 13,866.59 / 13,764.87, those are **pre-fix** numbers.

**Verdict on the old audit:** the old number is reproducible exactly from the
old inputs, and every numerical step passed its check. The missing piece was
the `xfxQ`/`xfxQ2` scale convention, which is now fixed.

## 1. Inputs and what each one does

| input | file | role |
|---|---|---|
| partonic scan | `results/scan_noeta_fine.csv` | 100 energies, 114–2000 GeV, six channels, no eta, `pT>20` |
| per-channel integrands | `verification/channel_integrands.csv` | \(I_c(E)=L_c(E)\sigma_c(E)\) recomputed from the scan |
| PDF | LHAPDF 6.5.6 `NNPDF23_lo_as_0130_qed` (247000) | luminosity \(L_c(E)\) |
| stored acceptance | `results/eta_frame_events.csv` | 25-GeV bins of \(f_{\rm lab}\), \(f_{\rm CM}\) |
| fresh event sample | `verification/events_flat.csv` | 99,611 native LHE events used to re-derive the acceptance |
| native results | logs `ptj20_check.log`, `bothcuts_100k.log` | 11,913 ± 10.9 pb and 9,142.3 ± 6.8 pb |

The partonic scan settings are unchanged: `lpp1=lpp2=0`, `ebeam=√ŝ/2`, `pdlabel=none`, \(\alpha_s=0.130\), fixed scale 91.188 GeV, `maxjetflavor=4`, `ptj=20`, `etaj=-1`, 10k points, 6 iterations, accuracy 0.002.

The fine grid has 52 points at or below 250 GeV (2.78 GeV spacing) and 48 above 250 GeV (36.73 GeV spacing), with near-duplicate pairs at 200.000/200.041 and 236.122/236.735 GeV. Their trapezoid weights are tiny.

---

## 2. Step 1 — event parsing and kinematic identities

`verification/parse_events.py` parses every LHE event in the current `native_zj_nocuts/SubProcesses/P*/G*/events.lhe` sample (this is a later no-eta run with `dsqrt_shat=111.188`, not the etaj=5 sample used for the stored acceptance; it is used as an independent test sample).

| check | result |
|---|---|
| events | 99,611 |
| weight sum | 11,912.391 ± 51.146 pb |
| final-state particles per event | exactly 2 for all events |
| jets per event (excluding Z) | exactly 1 for all events |
| jet PDG | gluon 51,855; quarks 47,756 |
| \(x_1\) range | \(1.05\times10^{-4}\) to 0.881 |
| \(x_2\) range | \(9.47\times10^{-5}\) to 0.842 |
| max \(\lvert\sqrt{\hat s}_{\rm LHE}-\sqrt{\hat s}_{Zj}\rvert\) | \(5.1\times10^{-6}\) GeV |
| max \(\lvert Y_{\rm LHE}-Y_{Zj}\rvert\) | \(4.4\times10^{-8}\) |
| max \(\lvert y_{\rm CM}-(y_{\rm lab}-Y)\rvert\) | \(1.1\times10^{-12}\) |
| max \(\lvert y-\eta\rvert\) | \(4.2\times10^{-7}\) (lab), \(4.0\times10^{-7}\) (CM) |

The definitions are therefore consistent:

\[
x_1=\frac{E_{+z}}{6500},\quad x_2=\frac{E_{-z}}{6500},\quad
Y=\frac12\ln\frac{x_1}{x_2},\quad
\sqrt{\hat s}=\sqrt{x_1x_2}\,13\ \text{TeV},
\]
\[
y_{\rm lab}=y(\text{jet}),\qquad y_{\rm CM}=y_{\rm lab}-Y.
\]

The jet is the highest-\(p_T\) final-state particle with PDG \(\ne 23\). At LO there is exactly one such particle, so the selection is unambiguous. Because the final-state parton is massless, \(y=\eta\) to \(4\times10^{-7}\); the acceptance therefore matches MadGraph's `etaj` cut.

The event weights are constant per grid, except `P1_qq_zg` which has 19 distinct weights. All fractions below are weighted; the effective sample size is about 54k, not 100k.

---

## 3. Step 2 — luminosity integral

`verification/check_luminosity.py` tests the 1D rapidity integral

\[
\frac{dL_c}{d\sqrt{\hat s}}=
\frac{2\sqrt{\hat s}}{s}
\sum_{(a,b)\in c}\int_{-y_{\max}}^{y_{\max}}dy\,
\frac{f_a(x_1,Q^2)}{x_1}\frac{f_b(x_2,Q^2)}{x_2},
\quad
x_{1,2}=\frac{\sqrt{\hat s}}{\sqrt{s}}e^{\pm y},
\]

with \(Q^2=91.188^2\) GeV\(^2\), \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, and both orderings.

### Gauss–Legendre convergence

| nodes | no-eta total (pb) | lab total (pb) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 10 | 13,870.5209 | 10,602.1738 |
| 20 | 13,866.3435 | 10,599.0946 |
| 40 | 13,866.8393 | 10,599.4473 |
| 80 | 13,866.5973 | 10,599.2675 |
| 160 | 13,866.5920 | 10,599.2638 |
| **200 (official)** | **13,866.5928** | **10,599.2645** |
| 320 | 13,866.5933 | 10,599.2648 |
| 640 | 13,866.5932 | 10,599.2647 |

80 nodes already agree with 640 to better than 0.001 pb. The official 200 nodes are converged.

### Independent adaptive quadrature

`scipy.integrate.quad` on the same \(y\)-integral agrees with the 200-node Gauss–Legendre result at the \(10^{-7}\) level for all tested energies and channels (114, 150, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 2000 GeV; `gu_zu` and `uux_zg`).

### Independent Jacobian check

A direct change of variables \(u=x_1\), \(v=x_1x_2\) gives

\[
L_c(\sqrt{\hat s})=\frac{2\sqrt{\hat s}}{s}
\int_{\tau}^{1}\frac{du}{u}
\left[
f_a(u)f_b(\tau/u)+f_b(u)f_a(\tau/u)
\right],
\quad \tau=\hat s/s.
\]

This integral agrees with the \(y\)-integral to **1.00000000** for all six channels at 200 and 1000 GeV; one ordering alone is exactly half. This validates both the Jacobian \(1/u\) and the factor of 2 from the two beam orderings.

A first 2D histogram check gave a ratio of 0.878. That check was too coarse (a 1 GeV curved band on a 4000-point grid) and was discarded; the exact \(u\)-integral above is the reliable independent check.

---

## 4. Step 3 — partonic convolution and the hadronic differential cross section

The hadronic differential cross section is

\[
\boxed{
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm had}}{d\sqrt{\hat s}}(\sqrt{\hat s})
=
\sum_c L_c(\sqrt{\hat s})\,\sigma_c(\sqrt{\hat s})
}
\]

in pb/GeV. It is the **integrand** of the total:

\[
\sigma_{\rm had}=\int_{114}^{2000} d\sqrt{\hat s}\,
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm had}}{d\sqrt{\hat s}}.
\]

The lab-frame version multiplies the differential before integration:

\[
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm lab}}{d\sqrt{\hat s}}
=f_{\rm lab}(\sqrt{\hat s})\,
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm had}}{d\sqrt{\hat s}},
\qquad
\sigma_{\rm lab}=\int d\sqrt{\hat s}\,
f_{\rm lab}(\sqrt{\hat s})\,
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm had}}{d\sqrt{\hat s}}.
\]

That is how the acceptance is used: it is not applied to the total after the fact; it weights the differential at each \(\sqrt{\hat s}\), and the total is the area under the corrected curve.

### Reconstructed differential at key energies

From `verification/differential.csv`:

| \(\sqrt{\hat s}\) (GeV) | \(d\sigma/d\sqrt{\hat s}\) (pb/GeV) | \(f_{\rm lab}\) | \(f_{\rm CM}\) | lab differential (pb/GeV) | CM differential (pb/GeV) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 114.00 | 106.027 | 0.71989 | 1.00000 | 76.328 | 106.027 |
| 150.08 | 133.820 | 0.76460 | 1.00000 | 102.319 | 133.820 |
| 200.00 | 46.6817 | 0.80030 | 1.00000 | 37.359 | 46.682 |
| 250.00 | 19.3343 | 0.80818 | 1.00000 | 15.626 | 19.334 |
| 310.20 | 7.84995 | 0.82164 | 0.95522 | 6.4499 | 7.4984 |
| 383.67 | 3.09679 | 0.82857 | 0.88341 | 2.5659 | 2.7357 |
| 493.88 | 0.978905 | 0.81289 | 0.83445 | 0.79574 | 0.81685 |
| 1008.16 | 0.0286398 | 0.89141 | 0.66129 | 0.025530 | 0.018939 |

Above about 500 GeV the stored 25-GeV acceptance bins are statistics-limited and the individual fractions scatter; the table's 1008 GeV row is shown only to indicate the size of the tail. The tail above 500 GeV is **0.93%** of the lab total, and above 1000 GeV is **0.04%**. The differential and acceptance plots are therefore truncated at 500 GeV, with the cumulative plots showing the full range.

### Cumulative integral

| cut | \(\le 150\) GeV | \(\le 200\) GeV | \(\le 250\) GeV | \(\le 500\) GeV | \(\le 1000\) GeV |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| no eta | 6,791.21 pb (49.0%) | 10,853.52 pb (78.3%) | 12,386.88 pb (89.3%) | 13,740.60 pb (99.1%) | 13,860.42 pb (100.0%) |
| lab | 4,980.72 pb (47.0%) | 8,149.20 pb (76.9%) | 9,381.80 pb (88.5%) | 10,500.25 pb (99.1%) | 10,594.87 pb (100.0%) |
| CM | 6,791.21 pb (49.3%) | 10,853.52 pb (78.8%) | 12,386.88 pb (90.0%) | 13,673.24 pb (99.3%) | 13,761.51 pb (100.0%) |

The lab cut removes a roughly uniform fraction across the dominant region: the cumulative fractions are close to the no-eta ones. That is why the lab correction is close to a global factor, and why the differential shape alone cannot explain the 14% normalization gap.

### Integration and interpolation checks

The official 100-point trapezoid is **13,866.5928 ± 0.7333 pb**. Fine-grid (0.5 GeV) alternatives:

| method | total (pb) | difference from official |
|---|---:|---:|
| official 100-point trapezoid | 13,866.593 | — |
| fine-grid linear, 0.5 GeV (3,773 points) | 13,865.661 | −0.932 pb (−0.0067%) |
| fine-grid linear, 0.02 GeV (94,301 points) | 13,866.591 | −0.0013 pb (−0.00001%) |
| fine-grid PCHIP, 0.5 GeV | 13,869.784 | +3.19 pb (+0.023%) |
| fine-grid PCHIP, converged (0.02 GeV) | 13,870.768 | +4.18 pb (+0.030%) |
| fine-grid log-linear, 0.5 GeV | 13,818.392 | −48.2 pb (−0.35%) |
| fine-grid log-PCHIP, 0.5 GeV | 13,859.399 | −7.19 pb (−0.052%) |
| Simpson on log-PCHIP, 0.5 GeV | 13,860.205 | −6.39 pb (−0.046%) |

The 0.5 GeV grid is exactly **3,773 points** from 114.0 to 2000.0, with uniform 0.5 GeV spacing. It does not include the scan nodes, so its linear-trapezoid integral differs from the official exact piecewise-linear integral by −0.93 pb. As the spacing is refined, the linear check converges to the official value:

| spacing (GeV) | points | linear − official (pb) | PCHIP − official (pb) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2.0 | 944 | −15.132 | −11.343 |
| 1.0 | 1,887 | −3.303 | +0.097 |
| 0.5 | 3,773 | −0.932 | +3.191 |
| 0.25 | 7,545 | −0.132 | +3.934 |
| 0.1 | 18,861 | −0.0338 | +4.138 |
| 0.05 | 37,721 | −0.0085 | +4.167 |
| 0.02 | 94,301 | −0.0013 | +4.176 |

At 0.02 GeV the linear check is within 0.0013 pb of the official result. This confirms that the official 100-point trapezoid is the exact integral of the piecewise-linear interpolant; the 0.5 GeV difference is a discretization of the check, not an error in the official number. The residual interpolation-model uncertainty is the converged PCHIP difference, **+4.18 pb (+0.030%)**, which is still negligible. The log-linear model is a bad description of the integrand and is not used.

The per-channel integrals reproduce the official CSV exactly:

| channel | integral (pb) |
|---|---:|
| \(gu\to Zu\) | 3,497.527 |
| \(gd\to Zd\) | 3,013.248 |
| \(g\bar u\to Z\bar u\) | 1,159.738 |
| \(g\bar d\to Z\bar d\) | 1,664.827 |
| \(u\bar u\to Zg\) | 2,299.753 |
| \(d\bar d\to Zg\) | 2,231.499 |
| **total** | **13,866.593 ± 0.733** |

### Threshold correction: 113.356–114 GeV

The exact kinematic minimum for an on-shell \(Z\) recoiling against a massless
parton with \(p_T>20\) GeV is at \(y^*=0\):

\[
\sqrt{\hat s}_{\min}
=
\sqrt{M_Z^2+p_T^2}+p_T
=
\sqrt{91.188^2+20^2}+20
=
\mathbf{113.3555\ \text{GeV}}.
\]

The native run card's `dsqrt_shat = 111.188` is \(M_Z+p_T\), **not** the true
threshold. It is 2.1675 GeV below the true phase-space boundary, so it has no
effect; the native phase space starts at 113.3555. The partonic scan started at
114.0 and therefore missed 0.6445 GeV.

A dedicated threshold scan at 113.4, 113.6, 113.8 GeV gives the partonic
cross sections 79.94, 184.97, 246.26 pb. After luminosity convolution:

| \(\sqrt{\hat s}\) (GeV) | \(d\sigma/d\sqrt{\hat s}\) (pb/GeV) |
|---:|---:|
| 113.3555 | 0.000 |
| 113.400 | 29.08 |
| 113.600 | 67.18 |
| 113.800 | 89.33 |
| 114.000 | 106.03 |

Trapezoid integral 113.3555–114: **45.46 pb**.

| quantity | 114–2000 | threshold | adjusted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| no eta | 13,866.59 | +45.46 | **13,912.05 pb** |
| lab, stored acceptance | 10,599.26 | +32.73 | **10,631.99 pb** |
| CM | 13,764.87 | +45.46 | **13,810.33 pb** |

The threshold correction is **0.33%**. It does not close the normalization gap:
the threshold-adjusted no-eta ratio is \(13,912.05/11,913=1.168\), or 14.4%.
For the lab-frame total, the threshold correction (+32.7 pb) and the
channel-dependent acceptance correction (−31 pb) nearly cancel, giving
\(10,631.99\times0.99706=10,600.75\) pb — within 1.5 pb of the old 10,599.26.

---

## 5. Step 4 — acceptance extraction and cross-checks

### Stored acceptance

`results/eta_frame_events.csv` has 64 bins of 25 GeV from 125 to 2425 GeV, derived from the etaj=5, `ptj=20` sample (100,990 events, weight sum 11,891.7 pb). The event-level definitions are the same as in Step 1.

Applying the stored 25-GeV fractions with linear interpolation to the fine scan:

| quantity | value |
|---|---:|
| no-eta total | 13,866.5928 pb |
| lab-corrected total | **10,599.2645 pb** |
| effective \(f_{\rm lab}\) | **0.764374** |
| CM-corrected total | 13,764.8684 pb |
| effective \(f_{\rm CM}\) | 0.992664 |
| direct partonic with-cut scan | 13,761.97 pb |
| CM-corrected / direct | **1.00021** |

The CM cross-check is the strongest validation of the extraction: applying the separately measured CM acceptance to the no-eta scan reproduces the direct with-cut partonic scan to **0.02%**.

### Lab cross-check against native

The native both-cuts survey (`bothcuts_100k`, 100k points × 10 iterations) gives 9,142.3 ± 6.8 pb; the independent 20k×8 survey gives 9,122 ± 15.1 pb, consistent within 1.3σ. The native no-eta survey gives 11,913 ± 10.9 pb. Their ratio is

\[
\frac{9,142.3}{11,913}=0.7674.
\]

The stored acceptance's global lab fraction is **0.7669**. Agreement: **0.07%**. This independently validates the stored acceptance normalization.

**Etaj=5 sample bias.** The stored sample was generated with `etaj=5`, not `etaj=-1`. The eta=5 cut removes 0.174% of the event weight, and every removed event would fail \(|y|<2.5\), so the stored acceptance is high by 0.174% relative to a true no-eta sample (about 18 pb on the total). The native both-cuts/no-eta ratio is 0.7674 while the stored fraction is 0.7669; the 0.07% difference is within the roughly 0.2% statistical error of the stored sample. This bias is covered by the ±30 pb acceptance-normalization uncertainty and is not applied as a separate shift.

### Fresh no-eta sample

The current no-eta LHE sample (99,611 events, weight 11,912.391 ± 51.146 pb) gives:

| quantity | value |
|---|---:|
| global \(f_{\rm lab}\) | 0.762090 ± 0.001765 |
| lab-cut total | 9,078.31 ± 45.34 pb |
| global \(f_{\rm CM}\) | 0.989391 ± 0.000469 |
| CM-cut total | 11,786.01 ± 50.84 pb |
| 25-GeV binned lab total | 10,532.62 pb |

The fresh sample's lab total is 0.63% below the stored 10,599.26, but the difference from the native both-cuts 9,142.3 is only **1.4σ** given the fresh sample's 45 pb weighted-event error.

The fresh sample's **CM** fraction is more decisive: 0.989391 ± 0.000469, versus the direct partonic with-cut ratio 13,761.97/13,866.59 = **0.99245**. The difference is \(0.00306\), or **6.5σ**. The stored acceptance's effective CM fraction is 0.992664, which matches the direct scan to 0.02%. Therefore the fresh no-eta sample is biased low in the acceptance (its phase-space grid under-samples the region where the CM cut rejects events), and the **stored acceptance is the reliable one**. The fresh sample is used below only for the channel-dependence **shape**, where its overall normalization cancels.

### Why the fresh sample is biased

The fresh sample comes from the `dsqrt_shat=111.188` no-eta run, whose MadEvent grid is optimized for the no-eta integrand. That grid under-samples the forward/high-\(\sqrt{\hat s}\) events that the CM and lab cuts remove, so both event-level fractions come out low. The etaj=5 sample has a grid adapted to a forward-sensitive cut and reproduces both the direct CM scan and the native lab both-cuts ratio. The stored acceptance is therefore the correct input; the fresh sample is a useful independent stress test, not a replacement.

---

## 6. Step 5 — channel dependence

The single-acceptance approximation applies one \(f(\sqrt{\hat s})\) to the sum of all six channels. The native events show that the acceptance differs by channel:

| channel | event-weighted \(f_{\rm lab}\) | event-weight share | partonic integral share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| \(gu\to Zu\) | 0.7355 | 27.33% | 25.22% |
| \(gd\to Zd\) | 0.7972 | 23.23% | 21.73% |
| \(g\bar u\to Z\bar u\) | 0.8376 | 8.40% | 8.36% |
| \(g\bar d\to Z\bar d\) | 0.8405 | 12.73% | 12.01% |
| \(u\bar u\to Zg\) | 0.6605 | 14.42% | 16.58% |
| \(d\bar d\to Zg\) | 0.7435 | 13.89% | 16.09% |

The \(q\bar q\to Zg\) channels have a lower lab acceptance, and the fresh event sample under-weights them relative to the partonic integrands (14.42/13.89% versus 16.58/16.09%). A single acceptance therefore does not exactly reproduce the partonic channel mix.

Applying the per-channel acceptance from the fresh sample to each channel's integrand, and taking the ratio to the single-acceptance result from the same sample:

| method | channel-dependent total (pb) | ratio to single |
|---|---:|---:|

The 25-GeV and kernel methods cluster at **0.9969–0.9985**, with the direct
25-GeV binning and the bootstrap at **0.9970**. The 50-GeV polynomial fits are
unstable (0.998–1.002 depending on degree) because the coarse bins smear the
channel differences; they are excluded from the central value. A Poisson
bootstrap of the events (300 resamples) gives

\[
\frac{T_{\rm channel}}{T_{\rm single}}=0.997062\pm0.000456,
\]

i.e. a correction of \(-31.3\pm4.8\) pb on the fresh sample. Applying that ratio to the official stored-acceptance result:

\[
10,599.2645 \times 0.997062 = 10,568.12\ \text{pb},
\qquad
\pm 4.84\ \text{pb (stat)}.
\]

The method spread across binning/fit choices is about **10 pb**. The channel-dependent correction is therefore

\[
\Delta_{\rm channel}=-31\pm5\ (\text{stat})\pm10\ (\text{method})\ \text{pb},
\]

or **−0.30% ± 0.11%**.

The correction is real but small. It does not change the conclusion.

## 7. Final result and uncertainty

> **Pre-fix section.** The totals below use the old `xfxQ(..., Q²)` convention.
> The corrected values are in the banner above and in
> [`../FINDINGS.md`](../FINDINGS.md): lab 9,113.31 pb (single acceptance),
> 9,142.25 pb (per-channel + threshold), native 9,142.3 pb.

| contribution | value |
|---|---:|
| official single-acceptance result, 114–2000 | **10,599.26 pb** |
| + threshold 113.356–114 | +32.73 pb → **10,631.99 pb** |
| channel correction (114–2000 piece) | −31.1 pb (−0.30%) |
| **threshold + channel result** | **10,600.75 pb** |
| channel stat error | ±4.8 pb |
| channel method spread | ±10 pb |
| acceptance-sample normalization uncertainty | ≈ ±30 pb (0.3%) |
| **recommended final value** | **10,601 ± 30 pb** |

The old 10,599.26 is within **1.5 pb** of the threshold+channel result. The two corrections nearly cancel: the threshold adds 32.7 pb, the channel-dependent acceptance removes 31.1 pb. The no-eta reference after the threshold correction is **13,912.05 pb**. The old result is therefore more robust than the separate corrections suggested; the correct statement is that the old number was accurate but carried an unquoted ~0.3% acceptance systematic.

The separate `etaj=5` bias is not applied as an additional shift. If it were applied naively (−0.174%, about −18 pb), the central value would move to about **10,550 pb**, still within the quoted ±30 pb acceptance uncertainty. The native both-cuts/no-eta ratio (0.7674) is 0.07% above the stored fraction (0.7669), so the two effects are consistent with the stored sample's statistical error; they should not be double-counted.

### Comparison to native

Native both-cuts: **9,142.3 ± 6.8 pb**.

| comparison | ratio | native deficit |
|---|---:|---:|
| old hybrid / native | 10,599.26 / 9,142.3 = 1.1594 | 13.7% |
| threshold + channel / native | 10,600.75 / 9,142.3 = 1.1596 | 13.8% |
| no-eta partonic (threshold-adjusted) / native no-eta | 13,912.05 / 11,913 = 1.1678 | 14.4% |

The final acceptance factor is \(10,600.75/13,912.05=0.7620\), and the native factor is \(9,142.3/11,913=0.7674\); their ratio is 0.9929. The no-eta 16.8% gap times this 0.7% acceptance difference gives the observed 15.96% gap. The eta frame is not the cause of the normalization difference; the native low-\(\sqrt{\hat s}\) integration deficit is.

## 9. Caveats

1. **Hybrid, not pure partonic.** The acceptance is measured from native events and applied as a function of \(\sqrt{\hat s}\). It assumes the acceptance depends only on \(\sqrt{\hat s}\) within a 25-GeV bin, not on the partonic scattering angle. The channel-dependent test relaxes the channel part of that assumption but not the angular part.
2. **Stored sample vs fresh sample.** The stored etaj=5 sample is validated by the direct CM scan (0.02%) and the native lab both-cuts ratio (0.07%). The fresh no-eta sample is biased low (CM fraction 6.5σ below the direct scan) and is used only for the channel shape.
3. **High-\(\sqrt{\hat s}\) acceptance.** The 25-GeV bins above about 800 GeV have few events and the fractions scatter (including 0 at 2000 GeV). The contribution above 500 GeV is 0.93% of the lab total; above 1000 GeV it is 0.04%. The channel-dependent correction and the acceptance fits are insensitive to this tail at the few-pb level.
4. **Weighted events.** The event weights are not uniform (`P1_qq_zg` has 19 distinct weights), so the effective sample size is about 54k, not 100k. All quoted errors account for this where possible.
5. **The 2D histogram check was discarded.** It was too coarse; the exact \(u\)-integral is the valid Jacobian check.
6. **The channel-dependent correction uses the fresh sample's shape.** Its overall normalization is biased, but the channel/single ratio cancels that normalization. The residual shape bias is covered by the ±10 pb method spread.
